# Examples-of-ETL-process
In this repository I show an example of transforming anomalies in a csv file

This is an example of an Extract Transform and load (ETL) exercise. originally we have the file 'Sales.csv' where all the records were not entered the same way (I invite you to open the file in a text editor like notepad). Some records lines are embedded in "" and others not. You will also notice inside lines some strings are written inside "" "" instead of "". In this notebook we will see how to transform those mistakes in the file in order to fully exploit the data.
